# Signs-of-Survival

## What the game is
The concept of Signs of Survival is based on project pathway 2. The player's ship has crash landed on an unknown planet. In the crash, the ship has taken severe damage and cannot fly as a result. The player must explore the planet and retrieve the scattered ship parts to repair the ship and finally escape the unknown planet.
